__Secure/Simple Content Management System__

Collection of ideas about self-owned distributed content system, which manages my videos, blog, mail, chat, calendar, notes and many more.

Primary language - Rust

Main focus is on __user owned data__ with quantum-safe encryption. System should be so simple, that even my grandmother could run her blog.

Open-Source

Modular

## Why?

I hate user "data privatization" made by Google, Facebook, Amazon etc.
I hate perma-bans, shadow-bans, rating manipulation, email privatization.
I want to own my content, i want to live in "my bubble" not in "google's bubble".
